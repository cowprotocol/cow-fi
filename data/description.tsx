      <p>Howdy! Let&apos;s have a chat about <a href="https://www.gnosis.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GnosisDAO</a>, a decentralized outfit that builds infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. Back in November 2021, they partnered with<a href="https://wiki.poa.network/docs/xdai-quick-facts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> xDAI</a> community to create the Gnosis Chain, an EVM-compatible, community-owned network. Gnosis was founded in 2015 by Martin K&ouml;ppelmann, Stefan George, and Friederike Ernst. Since then, they&apos;ve been pushing boundaries and building tools like<a href="https://safe.global/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Gnosis Safe</a>, Cow Protocol, Conditional Tokens, Gnosis Auction, and Zodiac.</p>
      <p>Now, let&apos;s talk about GNO, Gnosis&apos; very own token. It&apos;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#ERC20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ethereum-based ERC-20</a> token that was introduced during the<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/gnosis-ico-ends-early-12-5m-raised-after-tokens-sold" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Gnosis ICO</a> back in 2017. The total GNO supply sits at 10 million, and they managed to raise a hefty 12.5 million USD during their ICO. The final price of GNO, determined through a<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Dutch auction</a>, wound up at about 29.84 USD.</p>
      <p>Gnosis isn&apos;t just about building products; they&apos;re also nurturing the wider Ethereum ecosystem. They maintain <a href="https://www.parity.io/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OpenEthereum</a>, host <a href="https://www.dappcon.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DappCon</a>, run<a href="https://www.fullnode.berlin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Full Node</a>, and even invest in early-stage projects through the<a href="https://gnosis.io/ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Gnosis Ecosystem Fund</a>.</p>
